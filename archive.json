I think we might also want to add a sentence in the Sec. of \"one packet number space\" explicitly specifying that \"for single PN, use ACK instead of ACK_MP\", and change some texts in the ACK_MP frame section that is related to zero-length CID (the current draft says \"if the endpoint receives 1-RTT packets with 0-length Connection ID, it SHOULD use Packet Number Space Identifier 0 in ACK_MP frames\". ).\r\n\r\n> \r\n> Do we really need to send \"abandon path\" in both directions?

How does the server know whether it should create a new path or not?\r\n\r\nI think in single PN, sending \"abandon path\" in both directions is helpful. When the client sends \"PATH_ABANDON\", it promises not to send non-probing packets in the current activity cycle. It could send probing packets to reactivate the path a moment later if the client thinks the network environment has changed. After sending out \"PATH_ABANDON\", the client should still be able to receive packets from the server for a while on that path because there may be the server's inflight packets on that path. It was not until the client sees the server's \"PATH_ABANDON\", the client then knows that no more server's data is to be expected except for some out-of-order packets. So after receiving \"PATH_ABANDON\", the endpoint can start preparing to free memories and clear path stats allocated for that path. The time interval from seeing \"PATH_ABANDON\" to actually releasing relevant resources is going to be an important parameter, and yes, 10-30 seconds is too long. What would be a more appropriate number for this interval? \r\n\r\n> \r\n> In the single space case, the logical test may be to check the sequence numbers of the packet. If the sequence number of the new packet is greater than that of the path_abandon, then the client is reactivating a path that was abandoned previously. Maybe the client connected again to the same network, after some disconnected interval. The server can start sending on the reactivated path. If the packet number is lower than that of the path abandon, then the server should not reactivate the path.\r\n\r\nDoes it imply that we need to track the packet number of the PATH_ABANDON for a path that is closed? When a path is in a closed state, the server may reject any newly received packets unless it is a probing packet (back to our path initialization process). In this way, it should be OK to forget any info related to that path in the last activity cycle.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> In the multiple space case, if the CID is defined, there is no ambiguity.\r\n\r\n",

As the problem is similar to FIN-ACK&FIN-ACK when TCP closes, I kept the ACK in the graph (because the path_id_type=2 refers to the path where the packet is traveling, we want to make sure it is acked before we close the path.). Regarding the resource, I think if we keep a unified receive record, which is not per-path, yes, we can discard the sending resources. But if we have some path stats (e.g. how many packets received in total in this current activity cycle), we need to keep these data structures until we are sure that the peer is not going to send more packets on that path. Indeed, it depends on the implementation, but I feel it is generally helpful to have PATH_ABANDON sent in both directions.

This is basically the same issue as determining whether a connection is broken, just applied to a path. But that is not entirely sufficient, because the server needs to also infer whether the client still wants to use that path.\r\n\r\nThe monitoring of non probing packets is just an heuristic. The server observes that if the client is not using the path, and deduces that it should not be using it itself. That's not a bad heuristic, but it requires the client to send some kinds of \"keep alive\" if it wants the server to continue using a path. We may debate how often that should happen. Maybe reuse the same timeout as for jettisoning paths.\r\n\r\nAnother solution may be for the client to tell something like \"please don't use that path anymore\", but that requires adding a new frame as part of the core multipath specification. In draft-liu, this was done with a specialization of the \"path status\", setting the status to \"Abandon\". Maybe we should just use a simplified for of the PATH_STATUS, leaving out the complexities of managing priorities for the advanced scheduling drafts:\r\n```\r\nABANDON_PATH Frame {\r\n  Type (i) = TBD,\r\n  Path_identifier (i),\r\n  Error Code (i),\r\n  Reason Phrase Length (i),\r\n  Reason Phrase (..),\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n",

However if we think one packet number space is mandatory to implement, it would make more sense to have it the other way around and allow fallback to one packet number space, namely if the client ask for two packet number spaces but the server supports only one but would also lead to a successful negotiation.\r\n\r\nWhat do people think about this?",

The first thing is to allow people more freedom. If some implementors only want to use one option, they just need to implement one code branch.  Second, single packet number space requires the modification of loss detection algorithm, the way how rtt is sampled (the overall largest ack may not be the largest acked packet on a given path), and some delayed ACK strategies, which might take additional effort. People may also want to avoid round-robin scheduling in single PN as it creates a lot of holes in the ack range, so certain things regarding performance get coupled. Christian introduced many good practices and we are currently learning from it, so we probably need more experience on that.  ",

To avoid failure for interop tests, I suggest that we could negotiate the transport parameter like this: use 2-bits in the value field for negotiating one or more PN spaces.\r\n\r\n- 0x0: don't support multi-path\r\n- 0x1: only support multiple PN spaces for multi-path\r\n- 0x2: only support one PN space for multi-path\r\n- 0x3: support both one PN space and multiple PN space \r\n\r\nThe client could send all these 4 values in the enable_multipath transport parameter which depends on what kind of modes it supports. If the server just support one mode(such as one PN space), it could return 0x2 so that the client knows how to do next. If the server support both, it could choose 0x1 or 0x2 as it prefers, and make sure that the server don't return 0x3 as it need to decide which mode to choose. In 0x2 mode, the endpoints must not use 0-length CID.\r\n\r\nThen for people who just want one PN space, it would be ok to just support 0x2 mode. For the other guys who don't use 0-length Connection ID and want to get less overhead for ack ranges, they could choose to use 0x1 mode. And for people who want to support both 0-length CID and multiple PN spaces, they could choose 0x3 and of course it will add more modification in the implementation.\r\nMaybe this could meet everyone's need for experiments. \r\n\r\n",

      "body": "While discussing single packet space vs multi packet space designs, @martinduke brought up the topic of hardware offloading. The effect of any design changes on packet encryption/decryption should take HW offloads into account. As I understand it, single packet space would not modify the packet encryption/decryption logic, but the multi packet space design would because of the difference nonce length. Additionally, since multi-path would be a negotiated feature/extension, that would mean all connections that don't negotiate the feature would have the \"old\" model/logic, where as the connections that do would have the new encryption/decryption logic. IMO, this could significantly complicated HW offloads.",

      "body": "Currently, the multiple packet number spaces proposal relies on the sequence number of the Connection ID when a non-zero connection ID is used. With non-zero-length Connection IDs at both ends, it is indeed possible that over a same path/5-tuple, the client reaches the server using a DCID with a sequence number that is different from the sequence number of the DCID used by the server to reach the client (e.g., Figure 2). In the current draft, we consider that if the connection ID is zero-length, the packet number space identifier is 0, and applying multiple packet number spaces is thus not possible.\r\n\r\nI believe we can do better than this. Consider the situation where the client uses a non-zero length DCID to reach the server while the server uses zero-length DCID. In this case, it is the client that initiates the usage of a path with path validation, associating a server-provided non-zero-length DCID to reach the server. Once the first client's packet reaches the server on the new path, the server can associate the client's 5-tuple to the sequence number of the used Destination Connection ID, making a valid Packet Number Space Identifier. The client can easily map incoming packets on the 5-tuple to the associated DCID sequence number.\r\n\r\nDoes this sound reasonable?",
